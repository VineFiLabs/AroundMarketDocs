# 🚀 Why AroundMarket?

AroundMarket isn't just another prediction platform; it's a hyper-efficient liquidity engine designed to maximize the value of every participant's capital.

---

## 2.1 Self-Yielding Innovation: Making Capital Work
Traditional prediction markets leave funds "dead" until an event concludes. AroundMarket introduces the industry’s first **Self-Yielding Pool** architecture via **Aave V3 integration**.

### The Value Loop
By routing pool collateral into Aave, we create a sustainable ecosystem:

* **🛡️ Pool Owners/LPs**: Earn Aave lending yields *on top of* trading fees.
* **📈 Traders**: Enjoy deeper liquidity as yield-seeking capital flows into the platform.
* **🌐 The System**: Becomes more robust as the TVL (Total Value Locked) is constantly productive.

## 2.2 Virtual Liquidity AMM: Solving the "Cold Start"
Most decentralized markets suffer from high slippage and "broken" prices at launch. Our **Virtual Liquidity model** ensures every market is born ready.

* **⚡ Immediate Price Discovery**: Markets start at a fair **50/50 (0.5 price)** automatically, even before the first trade occurs.
* **🌊 Slippage Buffer**: Virtual liquidity acts as a "synthetic depth," providing a much smoother trading experience for early participants.
* **⚙️ Creator Control**: Market creators can configure initial virtual liquidity amounts to match expected volume.

## 2.3 Comprehensive Reward Ecosystem
We’ve designed a circular economy that rewards every active role in the AroundMarket universe:

| Role | Reward Mechanism | Benefit |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Traders** | **🍀 Lucky Pool** | Reach volume thresholds to win the protocol lottery. |
| **Creators** | **🎨 Creator Incentives** | Earn **0.05%** of all trading volume on your markets. |
| **Holders** | **💎 ELF NFT Perks** | Enjoy a permanent **50% trading fee discount**. |
| **Oracles** | **🔮 Data Rewards** | Earn fees for providing accurate, timely outcome data. |
| **LPs** | **💧 Trading Fees** | Collect **0.15%** of fees for providing market depth. |

## 2.4 Robust Risk Management
Security is our north star. AroundMarket implements institutional-grade safeguards to protect your assets.

### Multi-Layer Protection
* **🏢 Multi-signature Controls**: All critical protocol parameters and fund movements require multi-sig approval from the ELF LABS DAO.
* **🚫 Invalid Market Mechanism**: If an event outcome is ambiguous or cannot be verified (e.g., a game is cancelled), the market is marked `Invalid`, allowing users to reclaim their collateral safely.
* **🛡️ Insurance Pool**: A dedicated `InsurancePool.sol` contract acts as a backstop to repair any unforeseen fund shortfalls.

:::danger Risk Warning
Prediction markets involve inherent risks. While our smart contracts are built with security first, always perform your own due diligence before providing liquidity or trading.
